  ### Mrs. DeRoy


  Mrs. De Roy began her teaching career in 1993 in Hilo, Hawaii. Five years later she and her family moved back to Omaha, Nebraska where she taught until June of 2019. She is now retired but still involved with teaching the engineering process for the robotics club. She has taken teams to all but two of the CeenBot Showcases

  ### Mr. DeRoy


  Mr. De Roy joined the Robotics Club for the 2012 school year to teach programming and changed the club goals and the way it was organized, which led to the expansion and methods used today. As a former programmer he uses his experience to teach students how to program the CeenBot through teamwork and by encouraging them to explore multiple solutions to the years challenge.

## Our History

Mrs. De Roy began her journey with CeenBots in the summer of 2006 when she took a three week “Spirit Workshop” for teachers offered by the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO).  It was during that workshop she built her first CeenBot, a robot that is still used today. UNO had their first CeenBot Robotics showcase in 2010 with a handful of teams meeting at UNO.   Mrs. De Roy took her first two teams from Cather Elementary to the 2011 CeenBot Showcase . Today she and her husband take up to fourteen teams to the annual showcase and continue to be amazed by how much the students gain from the experience. As the program has grown so has the number of robots and students we work with.  The 2019 year sees the next phase of the ever-changing club with a new location, new students, from a variety of schools, and new website to make it all come together. We will continue to use the STEAM process as the basis of how we teach robotic skills. Art has been added to the STEM process in recent years and UNO incorporated it into the Showcase with an annual robotic art exhibit that runs with the showcase.
